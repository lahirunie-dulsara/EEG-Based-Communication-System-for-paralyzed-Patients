# EEG-Based-Communication-System-for-paralyzed-Patients

## Introduction

In this project, we have developed an EEG-based communication system that incorporates signal acquisition, amplification, filtering, and classification processes. The primary objective is to create a dependable and accessible communication solution for paralyzed patients, enabling them to connect with caregivers, family members, and their environment. This report outlines the end-to-end development of the system. By leveraging
modern technologies, this project aims to bridge the communication barrier faced by individuals with severe physical disabilities, providing them with greater autonomy and an enhanced quality of life.
